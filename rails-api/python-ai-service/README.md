# Python AI Service

The Python AI service processes natural language questions and generates insights.

**Workflow:**
1. Identify the intent of the question (inventory, sales, customers).
2. Decide which Shopify data is required.
3. Generate a ShopifyQL query.
4. Process the results.
5. Convert technical metrics into simple business language.

For this assignment, AI logic and Shopify responses are mocked.
